        <section>
            <h2>Logistics & Parking</h2>
            <p><strong>Parking:</strong> Please park only in designated places. Do not park on the grass, nor on the gravel in front of the clubhouse.</p>

            <h2>Seat Fees & Time</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regular Players:</strong> $5/hour</li>
                <li><strong>Five Oaks Members:</strong> $3/hour</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Time starts when you first get chips (but no sooner than 7:30 PM, or whenever the session officially starts),
                so effectively the first half-hour is free.</p>

            <p class="highlight">⚠️ Important: Please check out with the floor manager when you leave.</p>
            <p>If you do not check out, your departure time will be guessed and might not be accurate.
                While the new time monitoring program aims to keep this straight, programmers are ever optimistic—so please help us by checking out manually.</p>

            <p><strong>Payment:</strong>
               Cash is greatly preferred, but Venmo is accepted if you must.
               The cash box must be able to cash out everyone at the end of the night,
               so Venmo indulgence is limited to whatever the floor manager has with him.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Game</h2>
            <p><strong>Format:</strong> Initially one table playing Texas Hold’em (up to 2 additional tables depending on demand).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stakes:</strong> $1-$2</li>
                <li><strong>Buy-in:</strong> Initial max buy-in $200. Rebuys limited to $500 (or 1/2 the largest stack with table consensus*).</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> No cash on the tables.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Table Consensus Rules</h3>
            <p>The game defaults to Texas Hold'em. However, the game (Omaha, Round of Each, Dealer's Choice) or limits may be changed only with <strong>Table Consensus</strong>.</p>
            <p><em>*Table Consensus means unanimous agreement of everyone at the table. Please be mindful of other players when reaching consensus. Unreasonableness may be overruled at the option of the floor manager.</em></p>
            <p><strong>Bomb Pots:</strong> Per consensus only. Objectors are encouraged to skip the hand; fanatics are encouraged to respect the objectors.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>House Rules & Etiquette</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player Info:</strong> All players must have a current phone number in the player database.</li>
                <li><strong>Cards:</strong> Must be kept on or above the table. Any card that leaves the table is dead.</li>
                <li><strong>Showdown:</strong> On the river, if there is no betting action, a showdown happens in order. Please don't slow roll. It is best to let the cards speak for themselves.</li>
                <li><strong>Table Limits:</strong> 9 player limit on the first table (if the floor manager is playing). 10 player limit on second/third tables.</li>
                <li><strong>Splitting Tables:</strong> Experience shows more than 8 is tight and more than 9 is impractical. If 2+ players are waiting, tables will split by agreement or card draw.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Limit of two tables unless the host is not playing... or sometimes three ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but that third table is often a party gone out of bounds.</em></p>

        <section class="technical-section">
            <h2>The "Short All-In" Rule</h2>
            <p><em>Complicated "short all-in raise" rule: the person receiving the all-in usually does not have the right to re-raise.</em></p>

            <h3>Two Concepts:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Action Changing:</strong> A bring-in, complete, full bet, or a full raise (at least the size of the previous bet/raise). <br><em>This re-opens betting.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Action Only:</strong> A Check, Fold, Pass, Call, or an All-In Raise which is <strong>not</strong> 200% of the previous bet or raise. <br><em>This usually does NOT re-open betting.</em></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Rule</h3>
            <p>In no-limit poker, one must be facing an "Action Changing" raise to have the opportunity to re-raise. An all-in that does not constitute a legal raise is NOT considered "Action Changing."</p>
            <p>However, players for whom that all-in would have constituted a legal raise (and therefore is "Action Changing" for them) may raise.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example Scenario:</strong><br>
                1. UTG Raises to $7 (Raise of $5, "Action Changing")<br>
                2. CO Raises to $20 (Raise of $13, "Action Changing")<br>
                3. BTN goes All-in for $30 (Raise of $10. This is NOT a legal full raise. It is "Action Only" for the CO)<br>
                4. BB Calls for $30 ("Action Only" for CO)<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Can CO re-raise?</strong><br>
                Depends on what UTG does.<br><br>
                - If UTG folds or calls for $23 more ("Action Only"): CO's only options are to fold or call.<br>
                - If UTG raises to $33 or more (Legal full raise): CO sees "Action Changing" action and is free to re-raise.

            <h3>What happens if someone raises less than a legal raise?</h3>
            <p>The "50% Rule" applies. If you put out a bet that is at least 50% of a legal raise, you are required to complete the action to a full legal raise.</p>

            <p><strong>1. The "Under 50%" Case:</strong><br>
            If you put in a bet that is less than half a legal raise on top of the call amount, it is treated as just a call.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example 1:</strong><br>
                Big blind is $2. UTG raises to $8 (establishing the minimum raise increment at $6).<br>
                UTG+1 makes it $10.<br>
                <em>Analysis:</em> $10 is $8 (the call) + $2 (the raise). Since $2 is less than half of the required $6 raise, it is not enough to force a raise.<br>
                <strong>Result:</strong> UTG+1 is forced to make a call of $8.
            </div>

            <p><strong>2. The "50% or More" Case:</strong><br>
            If you put out a bet that is 50% or more of a legal raise, you must increase the amount to a full legal raise.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
                Big blind is $2. UTG raises to $8 (establishing the minimum raise increment at $6).<br>
                UTG+1 makes it $12.<br>
                <em>Analysis:</em> $12 is $8 (the call) + $4 (the raise). Since $4 is more than half of the required $6 raise ($3), the action is committed.<br>
                <strong>Result:</strong> UTG+1 is forced to make a full raise to $14.
